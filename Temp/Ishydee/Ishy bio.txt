BIO

Self-made singer-songwriter, multi instrumentalist and producer Ishy Dee 
has been making waves in the London scene since 2013, bringing in an 
ever-growing fanbase with him as he goes. 

Proficient but unhurried, Ishy’s debut EP released in 2016 ‘Calling’
was a labour of love - seven R&B tracks that gripped listeners 
with stadium-ready club beats still true to the underground. 
His creative balance is intoxicating, built on hard work and a 
rare artistic spark: the result is music that’s both heavy and 
delicate, made with soul but ready for the mainstream. “We’re 
all made from the same material,” opens the EP, but “we’re the 
designer kind.”

Ishy Dee likes to keep his supporters eager and surprised. 
The release of a new single the following year with ‘Come My Way’ 
featuring Truthz sent waves further than anyone could have guessed,
 with support from GRM Daily receiving co-signs from industry professionals. Back in the studio for 2021, Ishy’s set to make waves again especially with a new project 'FFR' (For Future Reference) which is about reminding your future self not to make the same mistakes.
