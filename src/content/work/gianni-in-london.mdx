**Fact:** Building a UK fanbase takes more than showing up — it takes strategy. For Gianni’s London 2025 takeover, we curated a full week of high-impact moments designed to cement his presence ahead of his upcoming London series.

We kicked off with a private welcome dinner at Nova, sponsored by Don Julio and Smirnoff, bringing out cultural heavyweights like Michael Rainey Jr, Freddie Gibbs, Headie One, PK Humble, and Abracadabra.

From there, the week stacked major media wins — with Gianni guesting on the Harry Stand out Show, the iconic 90s Baby Show, and recording an episode for Michael Dapaah’s upcoming podcast, maximising visibility across the UK’s top platforms.

We also aligned Gianni with the right brands, getting him front and centre at the Hugo Boss x F1 x Slawn Launch, where Hugo Boss styled and gifted him exclusively. We closed the week with a feature in BALL LDN Magazine, cementing his position at the intersection of fashion, entertainment, and culture.
