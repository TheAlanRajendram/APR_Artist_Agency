**Fact:** Paris Fashion Week isn’t just about runways — it’s about positioning, presence, and power moves. For Gianni’s debut at Fashion Week 2025, we delivered exactly that — coordinating a full-scale takeover that put him front-row, centre-stage, and on every invite list that mattered.

From being styled by a top celebrity stylist to sitting front row at the Kidsuper show, Drôle de Monsieur SS26, Songzio, and Blue Marble, Gianni’s schedule was designed for maximum visibility. Kidsuper even dressed him for their show, amplifying the moment.

We locked in exclusive access to key events, including the Avirex Pop-Up, The Purple Party, and our own private dinner at G Five Paris, bringing together 70+ influencers, industry insiders, and friends to welcome Gianni in style.

The week continued with invites to Chez Gala Dinner with Michael Rainey Jr, the Amiri Afterparty, Cova Club, Dior's New Collection Showcase, and the Avirex Le Rouge Event. We even secured a sit-down interview with License Magazine, expanding his profile beyond fashion.

All of it powered by Mercedes-Benz, with Gianni cruising Paris in a sponsored Mercedes GLE Coupé V8, turning every arrival into a statement.

**Event Highlights:**

* Front row at Kidsuper (dressed by the brand), Drôle de Monsieur SS26, Songzio, Blue Marble
* High-profile invites: Avirex Pop-Up, Purple Party, Amiri Afterparty, Dior Showcase, Cova Club
* Hosted welcome dinner at G Five with 70+ guests
* Private dinner with Michael Rainey Jr, Jeleel, Ivorian Doll etc.
* Interview with License Magazine for global exposure
* Mercedes-Benz GLE Coupé V8 sponsor for Paris Fashion Week transport
