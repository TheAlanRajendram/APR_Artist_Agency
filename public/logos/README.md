# Client & Partner Logos

Place all client and partner logo files in this directory. For best results:

1. Use SVG format for logos when possible
2. Use white/light versions of logos for better contrast against the dark background
3. Ensure filenames are descriptive and follow the format: `brand-name.svg` (e.g., `champion.svg`, `chanel.svg`)
4. Optimize all image files for web use to ensure fast loading times

If using PNG format, ensure they have transparent backgrounds.
