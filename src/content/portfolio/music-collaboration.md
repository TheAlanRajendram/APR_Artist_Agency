## Project Overview
APR Artist Agency facilitated an industry-first collaboration between experimental artist Aria Stone and neural interface company EchoWave. This pioneering partnership created the world's first bio-responsive musical experience, where audience brainwaves directly influenced live performances through cutting-edge EEG headsets and proprietary algorithms.

## Campaign Highlights
- Three-city tour featuring bio-responsive performances in custom-built geodesic domes
- Limited edition of 500 consumer EEG headsets that sync with exclusive musical content
- Interactive installation at the Museum of Modern Art's "Future of Expression" exhibition
- Award-winning documentary "Brainwaves: The New Musical Frontier" released on streaming platforms
- Custom-developed app allowing audiences to revisit and share their unique neural music experiences

## Technical Innovation
The collaboration pioneered the use of non-invasive EEG technology to:
- Translate emotional states into musical parameters in real-time
- Create uniquely personalized sonic experiences for each audience member
- Generate visual projections synchronized to both the music and aggregate audience emotional response
- Develop new compositional techniques responsive to neural feedback loops

## Results
- 12.4 million streams of the accompanying album within the first month
- 100% sellout of all live performances with a 400% premium on secondary market tickets
- 89% sell-through rate of limited edition consumer EEG headsets
- Featured in Wired, The New Yorker, Scientific American, and Rolling Stone
- 37 million social media impressions under the #NeuralMusic hashtag
