**Fact:** When Popcaan touches down in London, the city moves different. To celebrate his birthday — and set the tone for Unruly Festival — we curated a full week of culture-led brand activations, exclusive moments, and a headline birthday event that fused music, luxury, and hype.

From a BAPE fan meet-up to a private Rolex dinner and Ksubi gifting, the build-up delivered pure energy. It all culminated in a black and gold blowout at Nova Park Royal with 600+ guests, celebrity faces, and major brand moments from XIX, McQueen, Villon, Duppy Share, and Taj 51.

Media outlets like Link Up TV, The Voice, and Kaboom Magazine kept the coverage rolling, while platforms like GVO and Matt’s BBQ helped amplify the experience to fans everywhere.

* Over 600 guests, 100 VIPs, 67+ brand CEOs/directors
* Celebrity crowd including Patrice Evra, Headie One, Michael Ward, Krept & Konan
