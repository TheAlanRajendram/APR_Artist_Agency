APR Artist Agency conceptualized and executed a first-of-its-kind partnership between tennis superstar Sophie Chen and sustainable sportswear pioneer EcoRun. The collaboration produced the "Ocean Guardian" collection â€” performance tennis apparel made entirely from recovered ocean plastics, with each piece representing endangered marine species.

**Highlights**

- Global launch during the Pacific Open with Chen wearing the signature "Coral Reef Revival" outfit
- Six-piece collection featuring designs inspired by endangered marine ecosystems
- Chen-led beach cleanup events in Japan, Haiti, and California
- Marine conservation summit bringing together athletes, designers, and environmental scientists
- Immersive retail installations featuring actual recovered ocean waste alongside finished products
