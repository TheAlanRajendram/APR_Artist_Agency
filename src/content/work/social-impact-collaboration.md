- Development and installation of 87 solar-powered water purification systems serving 230,000 people
- Establishment of 45 community-managed water governance committees with 60% women leadership
- Implementation of regenerative agriculture training programs in 32 villages

- Training of 150 local technicians to maintain and repair water infrastructure


## Client Testimonial
> "APR Artist Agency helped us create something truly revolutionary. They understood that Liam didn't want to be the face of another charity campaignâ€”he wanted to use his platform to center the expertise and agency of local communities. Together, we've created a model that challenges the entire paradigm of celebrity humanitarian work." - Dr. Nadeema Osman, Executive Director, AquaGuard
