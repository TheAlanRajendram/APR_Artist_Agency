## Project Overview
APR Artist Agency conceptualized and executed a first-of-its-kind partnership between tennis superstar Sophie Chen and sustainable sportswear pioneer EcoRun. The collaboration produced the "Ocean Guardian" collection — performance tennis apparel made entirely from recovered ocean plastics, with each piece representing endangered marine species.

## Environmental Innovation
- Developed revolutionary fabric technology that converts ocean-recovered plastics into high-performance athletic materials
- Each production run removes approximately 12 tons of plastic waste from coastal areas
- Zero-waste manufacturing process powered entirely by renewable energy
- Carbon-negative shipping and packaging systems
- Blockchain verification system allowing consumers to trace the exact origin of materials in their garments

## Campaign Highlights
- Global launch during the Pacific Open with Chen wearing the signature "Coral Reef Revival" outfit
- Six-piece collection featuring designs inspired by endangered marine ecosystems
- Chen-led beach cleanup events in Japan, Haiti, and California
- Marine conservation summit bringing together athletes, designers, and environmental scientists
- Immersive retail installations featuring actual recovered ocean waste alongside finished products

## Impact Metrics
- 500,000+ units sold within the first quarter of release
- $2.7 million donated to marine conservation initiatives
- 35 tons of plastic waste removed from oceans through direct collection efforts
- 42% of purchasers were first-time buyers of sustainable athletic wear
- Featured at the UN Climate Action Summit as a case study in sustainable fashion

## Results
- 215% increase in EcoRun's brand recognition among tennis audiences
- Collection sold out three production runs
- Chen's "Plastic Neutral Pledge" adopted by 28 other professional athletes
- Pioneered new material technology now licensed to three major sportswear brands
- Winner of Fast Company's "World Changing Ideas" award in the Fashion category

## Client Testimonial
> "APR Artist Agency understood that this collaboration needed to go beyond mere marketing—it needed to create real environmental impact while still delivering elite athletic performance. They found the perfect intersection between Sophie's values and our mission, creating something that's changing both our industry and our oceans." - Marcus Rivera, Founder, EcoRun

## Long-term Impact
This collaboration has fundamentally altered expectations around athletic wear sustainability, proving that environmental responsibility and top-tier performance can coexist in the same product.
